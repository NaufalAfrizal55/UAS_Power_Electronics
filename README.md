## üìò Overview

This repository contains the final project (UAS) for the Power Electronics course. The project is divided into two main tasks:

- **Task 1:** Design and control of a Buck Converter.
- **Task 2:** Design and control of a PV Grid-Connected Inverter System.

Each task involves theoretical design, component calculation, simulation, control strategy, and performance analysis.

## ‚ö° Task 1: Buck Converter Design

### ‚ú¶ Specifications to Define:
- Input Voltage  
- Desired Output Voltage  
- Switching Frequency  
- Output Power  
- Permissible Inductor Current Ripple  
- Permissible Output Voltage Ripple  

### ‚ú¶ Design Steps:
1. Calculate suitable values for the inductor (L) and capacitor (C).
2. Simulate open-loop operation (no feedback control).
3. Design a cascaded control system for voltage regulation.
   - Include a complete block diagram.
   - Provide tuning methods or calculation of controller gains (e.g., Kp and Ki).
4. Plot:
   - Inductor current waveform (check current ripple criteria).
   - Output voltage waveform (check voltage ripple criteria).
5. Simulate:
   - Sudden load change: Analyze dynamic response and control stability.
   - Step change in reference voltage: Evaluate tracking performance.

2. Output voltage of inverter:
   - Plot in time and frequency domain.
   - Perform FFT to analyze harmonic distortion.
3. Overmodulation analysis:
   - Show waveform distortion and control performance degradation.
   - Support with simulation results.
